# AlfaDocs

AlfaDocs is an ALFA Exporter that will generate HTML Documentation for an ALFA data model.
This static site and documentation can be hosted locally to be used by those
wanting to explore the model in detail. It can be used as part of a continuous integration
build pipeline and the generated HTML content hosted on a webserver.

The ALFA language supports ways to document all parts of the model with multi-line,
single-line, sameline documentation comments. For readers of a data model, AlfaDocs
generates a web application with navigation and cross references to usages so
that they can easily view and understand the model.

The AlfaDocs web application is still under development. However for demonstration
purposes, the XSD Importer was used to import FpML to ALFA, and the AlfaDocs exporter
was run to produce the following site -
[ALFA FpML](https://alfa-lang.io/labs/alfadocs-demo/index.html).
