# Python Exporter

### Introduction

Similar to the Java and CSharp generators and runtime support from ALFA, this Exporter generates Python representations of ALFA definitions.

The Python support has been built for Python version 3 onwards. The Python generator is provided as part of an extended 'ALFA Professional'
version of the ALFA CLI. Please contact info@schemarise.com or goto `www.schemarise.com <http://www.schemarise.com>`_ for details.

The AlfaProCLI can be setup in the same way as AlfaCLI outlined in :ref:`getstarted`.

### Usage Steps

- Similar to generating Java and CSharp, Python is generated using the following commandline.

>```
>alfa -c -e python -o generated/python src
>```


- The generated Python depends on a `alfa` package which is made available as a pip installable package.
