# Alfa Meta datatypes

Meta programming is the concept of using existing programs as data.
Alfa allows a similar concept by allow existing models as data to
define further models.

Datatypes have been introduced to reference existing declarations
in Alfa. The datatype names should be a hint to their usage.

By convention, all Alfa meta type names will begin with the `$` character.

### UDT Name type
A value of these types contain a `string` referring to the name of an entity,
record, trait etc. `$udtName` is a special case where it can be any UDT
type name. Alfa runtime components will validate that the string refers
to existing UDT names of the given type.

- `$entityName`
- `$traitName`
- `$keyName`
- `$unionName`
- `$recordName`
- `$udtName`

```csharp
record Request {
   FeedType : dollarrecordName
}
```

### UDT type

A value of these types contain an instance of the type referred by the name.
The Alfa runtime will generate code to assert values assigned to these
types conform to the expected types.

- `$entity`
- `$trait`
- `$key`
- `$union`
- `$record`
- `$udt`

In the Alfa example below, if only `entity` types should be accepted to the save method,
using `$entity` as the data type enforces only an entity can be supplied. Likewise for the
get method, it only accepts a `key` type and returns an `entity`.


```csharp
service DBStore {
   save( obj : dollarentity ) : void
   get( k : dollarkey ) : dollarentity
}
```

If we take the Java generator as an example, the above will be enforced by generating the
following declaration for the save method. Other languages will follow similar patterns.

```csharp
 public interface DBStore {
    public void save( alfa.rt.Entity obj );
    public alfa.rt.Entity get( alfa.rt.Key k );
 }
```
