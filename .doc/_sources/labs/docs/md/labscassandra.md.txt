# Cassandra SQL Exporter

### Introduction

Given ALFA objects can be flattened to relational structures, generating SQL/relational table structures
was a next logical step.

[Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/) was selected as a candidate store purely for the ease in
testing the SQL CREATE statements in the JVM as part of unit tests on the generated SQL statements.

Other BigData/NoSQL Database SQL can easily be generated by extending this exporter.

Please note this exporter is **highly experimental** at this stage and is likely to change to be better
aligned with the flattened `table<T>` column structures.


### Usage Steps

- Similar to generating Java and CSharp, Python is generated using the following commandline.

>```
>alfa -c -e cassandra -o generated/csql src
>```


### Example
Given the following data model below, the Cassandra Exporter will generate a Create table SQL.

```csharp
record SalesPerson {
    Name : string
    Customers : list< Customer >
}

record Customer {
    Id : uuid
    Name : string
    DateOfBirth : date
    Accounts : set< string >
    CustomerType : enum< Standard, Gold, Platinum >
}
```


Generated Cassandra SQL:
```
CREATE TABLE demo.SalesPerson (
   genKey__ uuid PRIMARY KEY,
   Name text,
   Customers_seqIndex bigint,
   Id uuid,
   entry_Name text,
   DateOfBirth date,
   Accounts_setIndex bigint,
   Accounts text,
   CustomerType text
)
```
