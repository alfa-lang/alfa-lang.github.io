ALFA models can be exported to other programming languages and formats using
ALFA code generation tools. The exporters can be invoked from the :ref:`alfacli` or :ref:`mvnplugin`.

Although ALFA supports versioning of service and schema definitions, the
exporters currently use the latest ( unversioned ) definition, and older versions are ignored.

Exporters
---------

ALFA models can be exported to the following targets.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   java
   avro
   protobuf
   csharp
   typescript
   python
   javajpa


The following diagram illustrates the ALFA code generation targets and interaction paths.

Importers
---------

The following Importers can be used to generate ALFA data models. This is mainly seen as an aide to get started
with further refinements and changes expected to be performed on a copy of the generated model.
