This section details how use the ALFA modelling language to express your data models.

ALFA syntax is designed to be concise and consistent. It is not
opinionated on how your code is formatted. It has no restrictions on multi-line,
sameline statements. Line/statement termination is not required ( E.g. no
semicolon to mark end of a statement or declaration ). In some cases commas
are required by way as a convention to separate items.

ALFA aims to be natural and easy to use with a very short learning curve. The Alfa
compiler has been engineered to provide as much useful information in order for
the modeller to be most productive as possible. This is an area that continues to
improve as the toolset matures.

Those new to ALFA should first familiarize themselves with the :ref:`typeSystem` and modelling capabilities.
