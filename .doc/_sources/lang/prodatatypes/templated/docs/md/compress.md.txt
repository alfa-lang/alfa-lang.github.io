# compressed< T >

Contents of type `T` are expected to be compressed. The compression method(s) etc are implementation specific.

`T` can be any ALFA type. Some types will compress better than others. For example `compress< list< string > >`, is potentially a good use. `compress< int >`, perhaps not.



__Optional Parameters__


Parameters can be specified in the form `compressed< T >( k1 = v1, k2 = v2, ... )`. Currently the usage and types for the
parameters are undefined.
