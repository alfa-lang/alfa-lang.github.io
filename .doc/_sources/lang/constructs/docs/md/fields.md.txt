# fields

A `fields` declaration can be used to declare reuable field definitions similar to a data dictionary.

`fields` is a top level declaration and its entries are available for use in any UDT (User Defined Type).

Once fields are declared, they can be used in UDT definitions without having to declare the data type. Declarations can include a default value, as shown in the Currency field below.

When used in UDTs, declarations from `fields` can co-exist with those fully declared with datatypes.

```csharp
fields {
    Name : string
    Currency : string(3,3) = "USD"
} 

record Person {
    Name
    Age : int
}

record Cost {
    Price : double
    Currency
}
```

Use of `fields` is optional. However, its use can encourage creation of a more consistent data models.

Entries from `fields` can be used anywhere a field or service method parameter needs to be declared. In the example below, field declarations x, y and z are used in a `record` and `service`.

```csharp
fields {
    x : double
    y : double
    z : double
}

record Point2D { x y }

service Robot {
    reposition( x, y, z ) : void
}
```
