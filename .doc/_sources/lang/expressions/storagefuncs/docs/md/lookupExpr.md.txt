lookup
======

Finds a persisted entity from storage (e.g. RDBMS, Document Store, Big Data, cache) based on a key search.

Given `entity` types are stored based on a key, a `lookup` function and fetch the entity
with a matching key. This operation is expected to be fast given its a primary-key based fetch with
the option of being cached.

|1|:ref:`entityType` |The `entity` type being queried|
|2|:ref:`keyType`|The key to search for an entity|


__Returns:__

If no match found, a `none` value returned.


__Usages:__

- `lookup( <entity type>,  <key instance> ) : <entity instance> ?` - Object returned is optional

__Example:__
