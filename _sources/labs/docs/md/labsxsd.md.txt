# XSD Importer

Similar to ALFA 'exporters' generating other formats from ALFA files,
ALFA 'importers' will perform the reverse - generate ALFA files from
other schemas.

The first importer will be an XML Schema to ALFA importer. The XSD
importer will convert to the equivalent ALFA data types. ALFA types
are a superset of what XSD supports therefore there is no risk in loss
of detail. Any XSD documentation will be imported  as ALFA documentation
comments.

Given XML Schema allows extensions to be defined, the importer may not
be fully generic. Further development is taking place to ensure complete
coverage and correctness of the translated model.

To validate the implementation with a real world usecase, a popular XML
Schema model from the Financial Industry was
selected - [FpML 5.0](https://www.fpml.org/). The results of the import
was run through the AlfaDocs tools, to provide
the following -
