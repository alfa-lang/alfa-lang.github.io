# stream< T >

Values of type `T` that will be made available continously until terminated. Typically used for modelling remote service-based request returning potentially a large volume of data over time.

When translating ALFA to a target framework or language, if the target has no representation of `stream`,  it may be represented as a `<iterator of> T` representation in the target.
