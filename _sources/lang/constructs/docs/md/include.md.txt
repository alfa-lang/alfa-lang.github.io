# include

An `include` declaration can be used to include definitions from 
other `.alfa` files.


This is only required if when compiling an ALFA project, a root **file** is specified, as opposed to a directory.
If a directory is specified, the ALFA compiler compiles all files in the directory and there
is no need to use `include`. 

If on the other hand, there is a usecase to only compile a subset of files,
those can be grouped together using `include`.

`include` is a top level declaration, and is required to be at the beginning of a file before any other declarations.


```csharp
include "commontypes.alfa" 
```

Use of `include` is optional. Including the same file more than once or
reaching the same file multiple times transitively has no
side-effects as the ALFA compiler will read the file only once.
