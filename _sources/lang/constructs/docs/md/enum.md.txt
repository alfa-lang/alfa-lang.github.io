# enum

An `enum` is set of predefined constants that are associated with the given name.

```csharp 
enum Direction {
    North South East West
}
```

__Combining Enums__

>ALFA allows enums to be combined to create another using `includes`. An enum can `includes` another enum to include the other's constants. This is
>demonstrated below.
>
>```csharp
>enum CategoryA {
>    A1 A2 A3
>}
>
>enum CategoryB {
>    B1 B3 B3
>}
>
>enum CategoryC {
>    C1 C2 C3
>}
>
>enum AllCategories includes CategoryA, CategoryB, CategoryC { }
>```
>
>There is no implied relationship between AllCategories and its includes.
>It will simply contain all constants from its included Categories.
>
>This `includes` feature is supported in enums to avoid duplication of constants between related enums.
