# key

A `key` is very much similar to a :ref:`recordType`, but with restrictions on what field datatypes are supported.

A `key` is typically used for addressing an `entity`, therefore top level or nested vector types are not allowed as `key` field types. `key` definitions can  `includes` :ref:`traitType` declarations.

Multiple :ref:`assertExpr` blocks can be specified to perform validation.

```csharp
key CurrencyPair includes Addressable  {
    First : string
    Second : string
} 
```

Multiple :ref:`assertExpr` blocks can be specified to perform validation.
