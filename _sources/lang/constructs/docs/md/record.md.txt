# record

A `record` defines a data structure that will be used to contain a number a data items - fields. A `record` can `includes` one or many :ref:`traitType` definitions, thereby inherting attributes (i.e. fields) of the traits.

Multiple :ref:`assertExpr` blocks can be specified to perform validation.

```csharp
record Event {
    Id : uuid
    When : time
    Data : binary
}
```

A `record` with multiple includes.

```csharp
record Student includes Person, Examinable {
    Class : string
}

trait Person { 
    Name : string
    DOB : date
}

trait Examinable { 
    ExamResults : map< string, int >
}
```
