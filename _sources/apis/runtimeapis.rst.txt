Runtime APIs & Guides
=====================

ALFA provides runtime APIs for code it generates for target languages.


The runtime is documented in 2 ways, as HTML API documentation and a series of How-To questions and answers.
The HTML Docs is useful as a reference, however for specific steps to achieve a task based around an Alfa
language feature or its runtime API, you can refer to the 'how-to' guide.

The HTML API docs includes the list of the primary classes and interfaces in the ALFA runtime that users will
interact with. It is not however an exhaustive list of all the classes in the runtime libraries.
