ALFA models can be exported to other programming languages and formats using
ALFA code generation tools. The exporters can be invoked from the :ref:`alfacli` or :ref:`mvnplugin`.

Although ALFA supports versioning of service and schema definitions, the
exporters currently use the latest ( unversioned ) definition, and older versions are ignored.

Exporters

ALFA models can be exported to the following targets.

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    avro
    protobuf
    csharp


The following diagram illustrates the ALFA code generation targets and interaction paths.

Some of the code geneators are only available in the 'ALFA Professional' version of Alfa.
